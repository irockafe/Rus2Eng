The script "ouput_abbylingvo_definitions_examples.py"
Allows you to take a long list of russian words and output
a file containing english translations and sample sentences in a format
(tab-delimited) that can be easily imported to Anki.

For 100 words, it took about 10 minutes, occasionally re-entering captchas
at http://www.lingvo.ua/ru when necessary.
